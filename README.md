A Unity game made for [GMTK Game Jam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2020) by myself, [TsyooHUB](https://github.com/TsyooHUB), [tjhasan](https://github.com/tjhasan), and [kla3](https://github.com/kla3). The game is about a street artist attempting to speed portraits, with various distractions and obstacles that will mess up his painting to reflect the jam's theme, 'out of control'.

This game was built with Unity 2019.4 and OpenCV for Unity 2.3.8. Unfortunately OpenCV causes the game to crash with any build, so our game was unable to quality. The repo must be cloned and run in the Unity Editor in order to be played.

This game requires OpenCV for Unity to be imported into the Assets/Plugins folder in order to run.
